# DOM Tree Visualizer

Welcome to the DOM Tree Visualizer! ðŸŒ³

Have you ever wanted to peek under the hood of a website and see how its structure is laid out? With our tool, you can do just that! Whether it's a simple static webpage or a complex dynamic site, we've got you covered.

Simply input the URL of the webpage you're curious about, and our visualizer will do the rest. Behind the scenes, we use the powerful Puppeteer library to render the webpage in a headless browser, fetch its Document Object Model (DOM), and display it in an easy-to-understand tree format.

Imagine being able to explore the hierarchy of elements, from the root `<html>` tag down to the smallest `<div>` or `<span>`. You'll see how each element is nested within others, giving you insights into how the webpage is structured and how different components interact.

Whether you're a web developer looking to debug your own site, a student learning about HTML and CSS, or just someone curious about how websites are built, our DOM Tree Visualizer is here to help you explore the fascinating world of web development. So go ahead, enter a URL, and let's dive into the DOM together! ðŸš€
